# Hover-sleeve
The hover sleeve is a mechanism which you wear on your wrist and which is able to push the sleeve around your wrist away (or pull it towards your wrist). This is done by wearing a bracelet with integrated magnets around your wrist and a special shirt which has electromagnets around the wrist part of the sleeve which can be activated by closing a button of the front pocket of the shirt.
## Current progess
At this point of time there only exist some very basic prototypes, which should provide information about how strong the electromagnet has to be. More information about the prototypes can be found in
